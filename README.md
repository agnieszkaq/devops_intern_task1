Excercise 1.

I added coments to code. To use this code u need to write into console:
"./excercise1.sh name_dir_to_be_copied target_path_dir";

where:
"./excercise1.sh" -> is a bash code;
"name_dir_to_be_copied" -> your specyfic name of dir that u want to be copied;
"target_path_dir" -> the descignation path, u will put your copied dir;

Explanation:
I created archive, then compress files, after that copied to target dir. 
I did that way, becouse using compression took less space on disc and it makes faster copy process, than without.
